## Objectives for this Lesson

- Observe characteristics of wildfire in remote sensing data
- Find "unusual" pixels in time-series of raster data

===

## Specific Achievements

- Distinguish "stacks" from "bricks"
- Use MODIS derived NDVI
- Execute efficient raster calculations
- Perform PCA on "bricks"

===

## Import Clarification

Functions from the [raster](){:.rlib} package dominate this lesson, so load all
its elements and use them without a pointer back to the library. Import
functions from other packages as needed using the [modules](){:.rlib} library,
to make their source clear for training purposes.

```{r, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}', results = 'hide', message = FALSE}
library(raster)
library('modules')
import('magrittr', '%>%')
```
